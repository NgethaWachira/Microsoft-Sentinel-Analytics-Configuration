# Objective
A step bt step guide for setting up and managing analytics rules in Microsoft Sentinel. It covers configuring fusion analytics, creating custom rules with Kusto Query Language (KQL), and automating responses to security incidents. It also explains how to monitor real-time events, integrate external data sources like Cisco Umbrella, use watchlists to correlate data, and incorporate threat intelligence. The main goal is to help users effectively detect and manage security threats in their environment using Microsoft Sentinel’s features.
